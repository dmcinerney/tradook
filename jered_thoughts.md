# Thoughts about collecting letters into words and spaces

The first thought we had was to collect statistics about positions and sizes of each of the letters in an image.  We can use these stats to select objects which seem to form patterns that would suggest a word.  We tried to graph distances between boxes in the x direction, but we needed to separate out lines, so that we would only get the statistics for one line of text.  If multiple lines of text were in the image, the letters on different lines would create bad graphs.  Therefore, we first separated out the lines using a hardcoded pixel value of 15.  Note that we explored other options like clustering the hight of boxes automatically using k-means clustering and choosing the number of clusters using BIC scores, but we decided to just do it manually for the time being.
